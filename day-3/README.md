### 1. Design & Explanation

#### a. BCD to Decimal Encoder

A BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) to Decimal encoder converts a 4-bit binary input representing a decimal digit (0-9) into a corresponding single active output line. 

Working:
1. Inputs: BCD (A3, A2, A1, A0) where A3 is the most significant bit (MSB) and A0 is the least significant bit (LSB).
2. Outputs: Decimal (D0 to D9), where each output line corresponds to a decimal digit (0 to 9).

Truth Table:

| A3 | A2 | A1 | A0 | D0 | D1 | D2 | D3 | D4 | D5 | D6 | D7 | D8 | D9 |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  |
| 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  |

Logic Circuit:
- Each output line (D0 to D9) is driven by an AND gate combination of the input lines (A3 to A0).
- For example, D0 is activated when A3, A2, A1, and A0 are all 0. D1 is activated when A3, A2, and A1 are 0, and A0 is 1, etc.

#### b. Octal to Binary Encoder using OR Gates

An Octal to Binary encoder converts an 8-line input into a 3-bit binary output.

Working:
1. Inputs: Octal (I0 to I7).
2. Outputs: Binary (Y2, Y1, Y0).

Truth Table:

| I7 | I6 | I5 | I4 | I3 | I2 | I1 | I0 | Y2 | Y1 | Y0 |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  |
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  |
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  |
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1  |
| 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  |
| 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 1  |

Logic Circuit:
- Y2 = I4 + I5 + I6 + I7
- Y1 = I2 + I3 + I6 + I7
- Y0 = I1 + I3 + I5 + I7

The OR gates combine the respective input lines to generate the binary outputs.

#### c. 3:8 Decoder

A 3:8 Decoder converts a 3-bit binary input to one of the 8 output lines, setting that output line high while others remain low.

Working:
1. Inputs: 3-bit binary (A, B, C).
2. Outputs: 8 lines (Y0 to Y7).

Truth Table:

| A | B | C | Y0 | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 | Y6 | Y7 |
|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  |

Logic Circuit:
- Each output line is driven by an AND gate combination of the inputs and their complements.
- Y0 = \(\overline{A} \cdot \overline{B} \cdot \overline{C}\)
- Y1 = \(\overline{A} \cdot \overline{B
Continuing from where we left off:

Logic Circuit (cont'd):
- Y2 = \(\overline{A} \cdot B \cdot \overline{C}\)
- Y3 = \(\overline{A} \cdot B \cdot C\)
- Y4 = \(A \cdot \overline{B} \cdot \overline{C}\)
- Y5 = \(A \cdot \overline{B} \cdot C\)
- Y6 = \(A \cdot B \cdot \overline{C}\)
- Y7 = \(A \cdot B \cdot C\)

Each output is active high for one unique combination of the inputs, effectively decoding the 3-bit binary input into one of the 8 output lines.

#### d. 4:2 Priority Encoder

A 4:2 Priority Encoder converts 4 input lines into a 2-bit binary output, ensuring that the highest-priority input (the highest-numbered active input) is encoded.

Working:
1. Inputs: 4 lines (I3, I2, I1, I0), where I3 has the highest priority and I0 has the lowest.
2. Outputs: 2-bit binary (Y1, Y0).

Truth Table:

| I3 | I2 | I1 | I0 | Y1 | Y0 |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| 0  | 0  | 1  | X  | 0  | 1  |
| 0  | 1  | X  | X  | 1  | 0  |
| 1  | X  | X  | X  | 1  | 1  |

(X means "don't care")

Logic Circuit:
- Y1 = I3 + I2
- Y0 = I3 + \(\overline{I2} \cdot I1\)

The outputs reflect the highest-priority active input.

### 2. Differences Between:

#### a. Encoder & Decoder

Encoder:
- Converts multiple input lines into a smaller number of output lines.
- Example: 4:2 encoder converts 4 inputs into 2 outputs.
- Used to reduce the number of data lines.

Decoder:
- Converts a smaller number of input lines into a larger number of output lines.
- Example: 2:4 decoder converts 2 inputs into 4 outputs.
- Used to select one out of many output lines.

#### b. Encoder & Priority Encoder

Encoder:
- Converts multiple input lines into a smaller number of output lines.
- No prioritization of inputs.
- Example: Binary encoder.

Priority Encoder:
- Similar to an encoder but prioritizes the highest-numbered active input.
- Ensures the highest-priority input is encoded if multiple inputs are active.
- Example: 4:2 priority encoder.

### 3. Applications of:

#### a. Priority Encoder

- Interrupt Handling in Microprocessors: Determines the highest priority interrupt request to be processed.
- Keyboard Encoders: Encodes the key press on a keyboard, ensuring the highest-priority key is encoded if multiple keys are pressed simultaneously.
- Digital Circuits: Used in systems requiring prioritization, such as communication protocols and data acquisition systems.

#### b. Priority Decoder

(Note: "Priority Decoder" is less commonly referenced; it might refer to a combination of priority encoders and standard decoders in practical applications.)

- Resource Allocation: Ensures highest priority task/resource is allocated first.
- Communication Systems: Decoding signals where priorities are assigned to certain signals.
- Control Systems: Used where certain control signals have higher priorities.

### 4. Basic Functions of:

#### a. Digital Encoder

- Data Compression: Reduces the number of data lines by encoding data into a smaller set of lines.
- Signal Transmission: Encodes multiple signals for transmission over fewer lines.
- Addressing: Converts binary data into addresses for memory and other devices.

#### b. Digital Decoder

- Signal Selection: Decodes encoded signals back into their original form, selecting specific lines.
- Address Decoding: Decodes addresses in memory access and other addressing systems.
- Display Systems: Converts binary or encoded data into readable formats for displays.
