# 100 Days Verification Challenge - Day 2

## 1. Which are basic logic gates? Explain working with truth table. 

### Types of Basic Logic Gates:
- AND Gate: In the AND gate, the output of an AND gate attains state 1 if and only if all the inputs are in state 1. The Boolean expression of AND gate is Y = A.B

  - Truth Table:

- OR Gate: In an OR gate, the output of an OR gate attains state 1 if one or more inputs attain state 1. The Boolean expression of the OR gate is Y = A + B, read as Y equals A ‘OR’ B.

## 2. Why are NAND & NOR called the Universal Gates? What are advantages of universal gates.

### Universal Gates:
- NAND Gate: Can be used to construct any other logic gate, including AND, OR, and NOT gates.
- NOR Gate: Similarly, can be used to construct any other logic gate.

### Advantages of Universal Gates:
- Simplifies circuit design by reducing the number of different gate types needed.
- Can lead to more efficient and cost-effective implementations in digital circuits.
