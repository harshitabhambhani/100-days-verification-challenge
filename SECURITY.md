## Security Procedures

In case of a security incident, please follow these highly effective steps:

1. **Panic**: Run around in circles while flailing your arms.
2. **Scream**: Ensure everyone within a 50-mile radius knows there's an issue.
3. **Blame the Intern**: Remember, it's always the intern's fault.
4. **Call for Backup**: Contact your local superhero or IT magician.
5. **Take a Coffee Break**: You've earned it.


**Note**: For real security concerns, please contact us through a serious communication channel.
