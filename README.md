# 100-days-verification-challenge

## Project Overview

Welcome to the 100 Days Verification Challenge! This project is dedicated to improving verification skills through consistent daily practice. Over the course of 100 days, I will tackle various verification tasks, problems, and projects, documenting my progress and solutions here.

### Objectives

1. **Skill Improvement**: Enhance my understanding and capabilities in verification techniques.
2. **Consistency**: Develop a habit of daily practice and problem-solving.
3. **Documentation**: Maintain a comprehensive record of my journey, including solutions, learnings, and reflections.

### Approach

- Each day, I will select a verification problem or task to solve.
- I will document my solution, the approach taken, and any challenges encountered.
- Solutions will be organized by day, and each will have its own README file explaining the specifics of the task and the solution.
- I will reflect on my progress periodically to identify areas for improvement and celebrate milestones.

Feel free to follow along, provide feedback, and contribute if you find this project helpful!

## Inspirations

I am inspired to undertake this 100 Days Verification Challenge by Sweety Pinjani. Her work and insights in the field of verification have been a great motivation for me to enhance my skills and push the boundaries of my understanding.

For the specific challenge I'm working on, you can refer to the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPzgoM69QPc&list=PL44oI9iwgKq5MW17b3MxjPp1HvTIxFdoB&index=1&t=0s) that contains the questions I am answering as part of this challenge.
